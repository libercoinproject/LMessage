# PyLMessage Installation Instructions

For an up-to-date version of these instructions, please visit the
[LMessage Wiki](https://lmessage.org/wiki/Compiling_instructions).

PyLMessage can be run in either one of two ways:

- straight from source
 
 or 
- from an installed
package.

## Dependencies
Before running PyLMessage, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies
installed on your system.

Here's a list of dependencies needed for PyLMessage
- python2.7
- python2-qt4 (python-qt4 on Debian/Ubuntu)
- openssl
- (Fedora & Redhat only) openssl-compat-bitcoin-libs 

## Running PyLMessage
PyLMessage can be run in two ways: 
- straight from source

 or 
- via a package which is installed on your system. Since PyLMessage is Beta, it is best to run
PyLMessage from source, so that you may update as needed.

#### Updating
To update PyLMessage from source (Linux/OS X), you can do these easy steps:
```
cd PyLMessage/src/
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
python lmessagemain.py
```
Voil√†! LMessage is updated!

#### Linux
To run PyLMessage from the command-line, you must download the source, then
run `src/lmessagemain.py`.
```
git clone git://github.com/LMessage/PyLMessage.git
cd PyLMessage/ && python src/lmessagemain.py
```

That's it! *Honestly*!

#### Windows
On Windows you can download an executable for LMessage
[here](https://github.com/LMessage/PyLMessage/releases/download/0.6.3.2/LMessage_x86_0.6.3.2.exe).

However, if you would like to run PyLMessage via Python in Windows, you can
go [here](https://lmessage.org/wiki/Compiling_instructions#Windows) for
information on how to do so.

#### OS X
First off, install Homebrew.
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Now, install the required dependencies
```
brew install git python pyqt
```

Download and run PyLMessage:
```
git clone git://github.com/LMessage/PyLMessage.git
cd PyLMessage && python src/lmessagemain.py
```

## Creating a package for installation
If you really want, you can make a package for PyLMessage, which you may
install yourself or distribute to friends. This isn't recommended, since
PyLMessage is in Beta, and subject to frequent change.

#### Linux
First off, since PyLMessage uses something nifty called
[packagemonkey](https://github.com/fuzzgun/packagemonkey), go ahead and get
that installed. You may have to build it from source.

Next, edit the generate.sh script to your liking.

Now, run the appropriate script for the type of package you'd like to make
```
arch.sh - create a package for Arch Linux
debian.sh - create a package for Debian/Ubuntu
ebuild.sh - create a package for Gentoo
osx.sh - create a package for OS X
puppy.sh - create a package for Puppy Linux
rpm.sh - create a RPM package
slack.sh - create a package for Slackware
```

#### OS X
Please refer to
[this page](https://lmessage.org/forum/index.php/topic,2761.0.html) on the
forums for instructions on how to create a package on OS X.

Please note that some versions of OS X don't work.

#### Windows
