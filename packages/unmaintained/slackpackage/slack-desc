# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

pylmessage: pylmessage (Send encrypted messages)
pylmessage:
pylmessage: LMessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send
pylmessage: encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It
pylmessage: is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not
pylmessage: inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities.
pylmessage: It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a
pylmessage: message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content"
pylmessage: data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive
pylmessage: eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping
pylmessage: programs.
